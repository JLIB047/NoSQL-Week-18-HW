# NoSQL-Week-18-HW

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to create a social media backend that allows for the user to implement all CRUD methods on the user.  The user can create a thought, update it, and delete it.  The user can also add reactions to these thoughts, update theme and delete the reaction.  I found NoSQL to be much simpler to use than SQL.  Mongoose makes the backend messages much clearer and easier to decipher errors.  I've been getting better with Insomnia, but testing the delete routes were a challenege in this assignment.  I really enjoyed this assignment becuase I feel like i'm getting more of a handle on all the different technologies and tools we have used in this program.
